# Random Match Maker Android App

Random Match Maker is an Android application that allows you to add a list of contestants, shuffle 
them, let them play against each other in a knockout system and record the points.

## About This Project

This is a practice project that I'm working on as part of my Android development journey. 
My goal is to learn more about Android app development and to expand the functionality of this app 
as I learn more.

Please note that this app is currently a work in progress and may not have all the features or 
functionality that you would expect from a fully-developed app. However, I hope that by sharing my
progress, I can help other developers who are also learning Android app development.
